# 2020-CS172
Project for CS172, Shanghaitech, 2020

The project is about mathematical problem identification and calculation.
The work can be splited into two main sub-problems: Segmentation and Indetification

2020.12.16
A digit recognizer based on BOW+SVM is implemented whose dataset is MINST from Yann lecun.

2020.12.18
Opps! The recognizer is not perfect maybe due to the size of data images.
We will try to use CNN based recognizer!

2020.12.27
We finish the work. 
Congratulations!

Use of code:
Tensorflow 2.4, Opencv 4.5 and python 3.8
put a new image into /2020-CS172, rename it as originalImg 
run python main.py to see answer

2020-CS172/cnn are folder for CNN train, test and cnn_recognizer.
For train, you can change train=0 into train=1 in cnn/cnn.py and run python cnn.py

2020-CS172 are cut and preprocess fucntion
